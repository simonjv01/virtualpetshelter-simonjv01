# Virtual Pet Shelter
- Started with the Virtual Pet Shelter class and went down the list
- As I was creating tests it helped with creating the instance variables needed for the application, and I started
creating them as I was testing.
- I followed the format of the user interface with the example given, the only change I made was I displayed the hunger,
thirst, and boredom balances for each pet.
- I double-checked my code to make sure I didn't have any extra code that was not needed.  Like during Virtual Pet, I went 
back and realized I had a bunch of if statements that were not necessary.  I could have deleted them to make the code
cleaner looking.
- I will also note that I did have some trouble wrapping my head around the way to use a user defined object in a map,
like we used Map< String, Virtual Pet> = new hashmap<>(); I could use some more examples with how to interact with Maps
like these.
- Also, for the feed and water option I went by choosing a pet instead of feeding all, only because I couldn't figure out
how to do it all at once, which ties to my previous comment.
- Planning on doing a lot of review of Maps and Hashmaps in general to improve my understanding.
